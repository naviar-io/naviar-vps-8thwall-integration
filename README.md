# VPS web SDK

This is a SDK for web. Currently the `vps` folder contains core functionality and the `examples` folder has only an example for 8thWall apps.

The `vps` module includes the following:
- `vpsV1` and `vpsV3` modules for vps v1 and v3 requests
- `Helpers` - various functions for 3D transformations and camera and world positioning
- `thWallHelpers` - currently a module with single function to crop images from 8thWall's camera stream

## How to use the example
You should create a cloud-hosted app in your 8thWall workspace and copy all the files from `examples/8thWall` directory, also copy the entire `vps` directory to the root of your 8thWall project. The example supports only The Polytechnic Museum (Polytech) in Moscow and St Petersburgâ€“Finlyandsky railway station in St.Petersburg.
You can easily add your own locations if you have any. Copy an occluder and graphics to the `assets` directory, then edit `availableLocations` array in the `vpsV3PipelineModule.js`, line 50:

```javascript
const availableLocations = [
  {
    location_id: 'polytech',
    occluder: require('./assets/polytech.glb'),
    graphics: require('./assets/monster.glb'),
  },
  {
    location_id: 'Finlyandsky_station_63da64447ee6a98f5bff794e',
    name: 'finlyandsky',
    occluder: require('./assets/finlyandsky_better_occluder.glb'),
  },
  {
    location_id: '<your location id>',
    name: '<short name of the location>,
    occluder: require('./assets/<assets file>)
  }
]
```

## vpsV1 usage
`constructRequestData` - constructs form data for vps V1 request. `trackerPos` param is optional, if not provided all tracker position fields will be filled with zeors
```javascript
function constructRequestData(photo, photoWidth, photoHeight, fxfy, locationId, sessionId, trackerPos = null)
```
`sendToVps` - sends form data to vps and returns vps V1 response json.  
```javascript
function sendToVps(formData, locationId)
```

## vpsV3 useage
`constructRequestData` - constructs form data for vps V3 request. `trackerPos` param is optional, if not provided all tracker position fields will be filled with zeors
```javascript
function constructRequestData(photo, photoWidth, photoHeight, fxfy, locationsIds, sessionId, trackerPos = null)
```
`sendToVps` - sendsofrm data to vps an returns vps V3 response json. `url` param is a vps url. Available vps urls should be taket from `environments` variable
```javascript
function sendToVps(formData, url)
```

`environments` - available environments

```javascript
const environments = {
  stage: 'https://vps-stage.naviar.io/vps/api/v3',
  prod: 'https://vps.naviar.io/vps/api/v3',
}
```

## Helpers
The `Helpers` module contains the following helpers:

__Converters:__
```typescript
// position from blender to threejs
cameraPosBlenderToThree(pos: [number, number, number]): [number, number, number]

// position from threejs to blender
cameraPosThreeToBlender(pos: [number, number, number]): [number, number, number]

// angles from dergres to radians
toRads(rot: number[]): numebr[]

// threejs quaternion to blender extrinsic angles in radians
threeQuaterniotToBlenderAngles(rot: THREE.Quaternion): [number, number, number]

// extrinsic XYZ euler angles in radians to quaternion
extrinsicEulerAnglesToQuat(angles: [number, number, number]): THREE.Quaternion

// conversts Blender's extrinsic XYZ euler angles in degres to threejs quaternion
cameraRotationToThreeQuaternion(rot: [number, number, number]): THREE.Quaternion

// corrects camera position with respect to response delay
correctPosition(
  lastPos: [number, number, number],
  vpsPos: [number, number, number],
  currentPos: [number, number, number]
): [number, number, number]

// corrects camera angle with respect to response delay
correctAngle(
  lastAngle,
  vpsAngle,
  currentAngle
  ): THREE.Quaternion

// rotates 'obj' around the 'around' object with a 'quaternion'
rotateAround(
  obj: THREE.Object3D,
  around: THREE.Object3D,
  quaternion: THREE.Quaternion
): void
